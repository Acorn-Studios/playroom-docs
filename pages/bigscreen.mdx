# Adding a Big Screen to the Game

## Introduction
Playroom games can support a TV mode, where the game is displayed on a big screen and the players use their phones as controllers to interact with the game. This is a great way to get the whole family involved in the game.

This way you can have in-person party games not so different from Jackbox games.
