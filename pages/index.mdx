## What is Playroom Kit?

## What's the API like?

Playroom Kit provides a simple API to set or get the state of the game room. The state is automatically synced between all players and screens.

```js
import { getState, setState } from 'playroomkit'

// Set some game state, this will be synced to all players
setState("timeRemaining", 60);
// ...

// One some other device: Get the time remaining
const time = getState("timeRemaining");
```

Playroom also takes care of player and room management. You just need to call `insertCoin()` somewhere in your game to show the lobby UI.

```js
import { insertCoin } from 'playroomkit'

// Show the lobby UI
await insertCoin();

// Handle players joining the game
onPlayerJoin((player) => {
  console.log(`${player.getProfile().name} joined the game`);
});
```
