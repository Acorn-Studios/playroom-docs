# Playroom Kit



Playroom Kit simplifies the development of real-time web-based multiplayer games by offering seamless synchronization and state management features. With its convenient integration capabilities, you can effortlessly incorporate the kit into popular game engines and libraries, transforming any game into a multiplayer experience.


With our low-code integration, no game needs to remain limited to single-player mode. We believe that gaming is more enjoyable when shared with friends, whether they are online, nearby, connected through Discord, part of a Twitch community, or even gathered with family at home. With Playroom Kit, you have the flexibility to create your game to suit any multiplayer scenario
