# Using Playroom with Cocos Creator

[Cocos Creator](https://www.cocos.com/en/creator) is a 2D/3D game engine that supports JavaScript and TypeScript. You can use Playroom with Cocos Creator to build multiplayer games.

## Setup

Follow these steps to import Playroom into your project.

- Create a new project in Cocos Creator.

- Get a [multiplayer.full.umd.js](https://unpkg.com/playroomkit/multiplayer.full.umd.js) and [types.d.ts](https://unpkg.com/playroomkit/types.d.ts) (rename to playroom.d.ts for visibility) file into your project (newer versions of Cocos Creator default to TypeScript).

- Import the multiplayer.full.umd.js as a plugin

<img src="/images/cocos1.png" style={{maxHeight: "500px", marginTop: '40px;'}} />

- Now you can start using Playroom in your Cocos Creator scripts like this:

```js copy
import * as PlayroomType from './playroom.d.ts';
const Playroom: typeof PlayroomType = window.Playroom;

export class MyScript extends Component {

    async start() {       
        await Playroom.insertCoin({
            // any options here
        });
    }
}
```
