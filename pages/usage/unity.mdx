# Using Unity with Playroom Kit

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

    The Unity SDK currently only supports **Unity Web.** This is an experimental technology.

Unity is a versatile platform for creating dynamic experiences, ranging from engaging games to immersive simulations. Playroom Kit complements Unity by simplifying the development of multiplayer games and interactive web-based applications.

Playroom provides a Unity-friendly API for interacting with common Playroom states and player data. 

## Mock mode
Since the current SDK only supports Unity Web, we've introduced **Mock mode** - a way to test out your game's logic in Unity's Preview mode, without having to build for web every time.


{/* 
Here is a simple demo React app that uses Playroom Kit:


import Preview from '../../components/preview'

<Preview src="/demos/react1.html" />

You can see the full source code [here](https://github.com/asadm/playroom-docs/blob/main/public/demos/react1.html).
