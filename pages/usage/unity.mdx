# Using Unity with Playroom Kit

Unity is the most popular game engine, it's also a great way to make web games thanks to the [WebGL export option](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-building.html). 

Playroom Kit complements Unity by simplifying the development of multiplayer games and interactive web-based applications.

## Getting started

### 1. Install the SDK
The SDK is available as a Unity package. You can download the latest version from the [releases page](https://github.com/asadm/playroom-unity/releases) (download `playroomkit.unitypackage` file).

To install, simply drag the package into your Unity project and import all files.

### 2. Initialize Playroom
The SDK can be initialized by calling `PlayroomKit.InsertCoin` in your game's `Start` method. You'll need to pass in a callback function that will be called when the host launches the game.

```csharp
using Playroom;
// ...

void Start() {
    PlayroomKit.InsertCoin(() => {
        // The host has launched the game, you can start your game logic here.
    });
}
```

### 3. Set / Get game state
You can set and get the game state using the `PlayroomKit.SetState` and `PlayroomKit.GetState` methods. The game state is automatically synced with other players.

See the [API reference](/apidocs/unity) for more information.

### 4. Export to WebGL

- To export your game to WebGL, go to `File > Build Settings` and select `WebGL` as the platform. 
- Click Player Settings and set the `Resolution and Presentation > Run In Background` option to `true`.
- Change `WebGL Template` to `Minimal` or `PWA`.
- Under `Publishing Settings`, set the `Compression Format` to `None`, this is to make sure the build works with most web servers including itch.io.
- Close the Player Settings window and then click `Build` to export your game as a web page.
- Once it has finished building, you can go into the output build folder and run `python -m http.server` to start a local web server. You can then open the game in your browser by going to `http://localhost:8000`.

Do note that Playroom Kit only works with WebGL builds. 

## Mock mode
Since the current SDK only supports Unity Web, we've introduced **Mock mode** - a way to test out your game's logic in Unity's Preview mode, without having to build for web every time.
The mock mode doesn't connect to the Playroom server, instead it just mocks the API calls within Unity. This allows you to test out your game's logic without having to build for web every time.

**The Mock mode only works in single player mode for now.**

## Simple Example

Use `WASD` or `Arrow keys` to move the player around. The player's position is synced with other players in real-time.

Code for this example can be found [here]( https://github.com/asadm/playroom-docs/tree/main/examples/unity-hello-world).

## FAQs and Tips

### How to display player's profile picture in Unity?
PlayroomPlayer.GetProfile().photo is formatted as `data:image/svg+xml,{svg encoded for url}`. In order to display it in Unity:
- Remove data:image/svg+xml from the string.
- Decode the rest using HttpUtility.UrlDecode()
- Display the result into an SVGImage component.

**Warning: Requires Unity's Vector Graphics package from com.unity.vectorgraphics which is an experimental package**

```csharp
 private void LoadSVG(string svgBytes) {
    // Split the string to escape the real data
    svgBytes = svgBytes.Split(",".ToCharArray(), 2)[1];
    // Decode from the URL encoding
    svgBytes = HttpUtility.UrlDecode(svgBytes);
    VectorUtils.TessellationOptions tesselationOptions = new VectorUtils.TessellationOptions();

    using (StringReader reader = new StringReader(svgBytes))
    {
        SVGParser.SceneInfo sceneInfo = SVGParser.ImportSVG(reader);
        tesselationOptions.MaxCordDeviation = float.MaxValue;
        tesselationOptions.MaxTanAngleDeviation = float.MaxValue;
        tesselationOptions.StepDistance = 1f;
        tesselationOptions.SamplingStepSize = 0.1f;

        List<VectorUtils.Geometry> geoms =
        VectorUtils.TessellateScene(sceneInfo.Scene, tesselationOptions);

        // Build a sprite with the tessellated geometry.
        Sprite sprite = VectorUtils.BuildSprite(geoms, 100.0f, VectorUtils.Alignment.Center, Vector2.zero, 128, true);
        sprite.name = "SVGimage";
        profilePicture.sprite = sprite;
    }
}
```

### Aurea NetLayer: a higher level API for Unity

**GuilhermeAlanJohann** from our Discord community has created a [higher level plugin](https://gitlab.com/PCista/com.aurea.packages.netlayer) for Unity that makes it easier to use Playroom with Unity.


#### Features
- Sync position and rotations of objects over the network (supports interpolation)
- Different object authorities (Host and LocalPlayer)
- Spawn/Unspawn objects over the network
- Send Messages to others (including or excluding yourself)
- RPC (...kind of). It uses Unity message system.
