Unity is a versatile platform for creating dynamic experiences, ranging from engaging games to immersive simulations. The Playroom Kit complements Unity by simplifying the development of multiplayer games and interactive web-based applications.

Playroom provides a Unity-friendly API for interacting with common Playroom states and player data.
