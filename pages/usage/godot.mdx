# Using Playroom with Godot 4 (Web only)

[Godot](https://godotengine.org/) is a free and open-source game engine. Godot has [JavaScriptBridge](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_javascriptbridge.html) support, which connects the engine with the browser's JavaScript. We can use this to use Playroom with Godot.

<Callout emoji="👷🏼‍♀️">
  Godot 4's web export is not production-grade yet. There are open bugs in [Chromium](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1324296#c6) and in [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/83548) [itself](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/70691).
</Callout>

## Setup

- In your Godot project, you need to enable Web Export. You can do this by going to `Project > Export > Add` and clicking `Web`.

- With `Web` selected, add Playroom to the `HTML > Head` section:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18.2.0/umd/react.development.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18.2.0/umd/react-dom.development.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/playroomkit/multiplayer.umd.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

You can close the export window now.

- If you completed the above steps correctly, you should see a `Run in browser` menu option in when you click the `Remote Debug` button:

## Using Playroom in GDScript

To initialize Playroom in your game ie. show the Playroom lobby, you need to call `Playroom.insertCoin()` in some script. `insertCoin` and other Playroom functions also support providing a callback function. You need to make your GDScript callback function available to the JS context. 

Here is an example of how to initialize Playroom on a button press:

```gdscript
extends Button

var Playroom = JavaScriptBridge.get_interface("Playroom")

# Keep a reference to the callback so it doesn't get garbage collected
var jsBridgeReferences = []
func bridgeToJS(cb):
	var jsCallback = JavaScriptBridge.create_callback(cb)
	jsBridgeReferences.push_back(jsCallback)
	return jsCallback

# Called when the "Play Multiplayer" button is pressed.
func _on_pressed():
	var initOptions = JavaScriptBridge.create_object("Object");
	Playroom.insertCoin(initOptions, bridgeToJS(onInsertCoin));

# Called when the host has started the game
func onInsertCoin(args):
	print("Coin Inserted")
	Playroom.onPlayerJoin(bridgeToJS(onPlayerJoin))

# Called when a new player joins the game
func onPlayerJoin(args):
	var state = args[0];
	print("new player: ", state.id)
	print(state.getProfile().name)
	
	# Listen to onQuit event
	var onQuitCb = func onPlayerQuit(args):
		print("player quit: ", state.id)
	state.onQuit(bridgeToJS(onQuitCb))

```

The above code will show the familiar [Playroom lobby](components/lobby) when the button is pressed. Players can host and join rooms without any code on your side. 

When the host starts the game, the `onInsertCoin` callback will be called. The `onPlayerJoin` callback will be called for all existing and new players, so you can add characters for them. When a player quits the game, the `onPlayerQuit` callback will be called, so you can remove their character.

  Do note that Playroom will not work in the Godot editor. You need to export your game and run it in the browser.

  You can use the `Run in browser` option in the `Remote Debug` menu to quickly build and open your game in the browser.

  If you host the game on your own server, Godot requires the following headers to be present, add these in your `.htaccess` or however your server lets you:

```
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

See the full [source code](https://github.com/asadm/playroom-docs/tree/main/examples/godot-hello-world) for this demo.


## Next Steps

- You should be able to use most of [Playroom API](/docs/api.md) to build your game.
- You can use [On-screen Joystick](/components/joystick) to easily add a joystick on screen.
