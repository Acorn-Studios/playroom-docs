# Using Playroom with Godot 3 & 4 (Web only)

[Godot](https://godotengine.org/) is a free and open-source game engine. Godot has [JavaScriptBridge](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_javascriptbridge.html) support ([JavaScript](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.5/classes/class_javascript.html) in Godot 3), which connects the engine with the browser's JavaScript. We can use this to use Playroom with Godot.

  Godot 4's web export is not production-grade yet. There are open bugs in [Chromium](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1324296#c6) and in [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/83548) [itself](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/70691).

	<b> Use Godot 3 for any production web games.</b>
</Callout>

## Setup

- In your Godot 3 or 4 project, you need to enable Web Export. You can do this by going to `Project > Export > Add` and clicking `Web`.

- With `Web` selected, add Playroom to the `HTML > Head` section:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/playroomkit/multiplayer.full.umd.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

You can close the export window now.

- If you completed the above steps correctly, you should see a `Run in browser` menu option in when you click the `Remote Debug` button:

## Using Playroom in GDScript

To initialize Playroom in your game ie. show the Playroom lobby, you need to call `Playroom.insertCoin()` in some script. `insertCoin` and other Playroom functions also support providing a callback function. You need to make your GDScript callback function available to the JS context. 

Here is an example of how to initialize Playroom on a button press:

<Tabs items={['Godot 3', 'Godot 4']}>
  <Tab>
		### Godot 3
```gdscript
extends Button

var Playroom = JavaScript.get_interface("Playroom")

# Keep a reference to the callback so it doesn't get garbage collected
var jsBridgeReferences = []
func bridgeToJS(cb):
	var jsCallback = JavaScript.create_callback(cb)
	jsBridgeReferences.push_back(jsCallback)
	return jsCallback

# Called when the "Play Multiplayer" button is pressed.
func _on_pressed():
	var initOptions = JavaScript.create_object("Object");
	Playroom.insertCoin(initOptions, bridgeToJS("onInsertCoin"));

# Called when the host has started the game
func onInsertCoin(args):
	print("Coin Inserted")
	Playroom.onPlayerJoin(bridgeToJS("onPlayerJoin"))

# Called when a new player joins the game
func onPlayerJoin(args):
	var state = args[0];
	print("new player: ", state.id)
	print(state.getProfile().name)
	
	# Listen to onQuit event
	state.onQuit(bridgeToJS("onPlayerQuit"))

func onPlayerQuit(args):
	var state = args[0];
	print("player quit: ", state.id)
		```
	</Tab>
	<Tab>
		### Godot 4
		
```gdscript
extends Button

var Playroom = JavaScriptBridge.get_interface("Playroom")

# Keep a reference to the callback so it doesn't get garbage collected
var jsBridgeReferences = []
func bridgeToJS(cb):
	var jsCallback = JavaScriptBridge.create_callback(cb)
	jsBridgeReferences.push_back(jsCallback)
	return jsCallback

# Called when the "Play Multiplayer" button is pressed.
func _on_pressed():
	var initOptions = JavaScriptBridge.create_object("Object");
	Playroom.insertCoin(initOptions, bridgeToJS(onInsertCoin));

# Called when the host has started the game
func onInsertCoin(args):
	print("Coin Inserted")
	Playroom.onPlayerJoin(bridgeToJS(onPlayerJoin))

# Called when a new player joins the game
func onPlayerJoin(args):
	var state = args[0];
	print("new player: ", state.id)
	print(state.getProfile().name)
	
	# Listen to onQuit event
	var onQuitCb = func onPlayerQuit(args):
		print("player quit: ", state.id)
	state.onQuit(bridgeToJS(onQuitCb))

```
</Tab>
</Tabs>


The above code will show the familiar [Playroom lobby](components/lobby) when the button is pressed. Players can host and join rooms without any code on your side. 

When the host starts the game, the `onInsertCoin` callback will be called. The `onPlayerJoin` callback will be called for all existing and new players, so you can add characters for them. When a player quits the game, the `onPlayerQuit` callback will be called, so you can remove their character.

  Do note that Playroom will not work in the Godot editor. You need to export your game and run it in the browser.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
  You can use the `Run in browser` option in the `Remote Debug` menu to quickly build and open your game in the browser.

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
  If you host the game on your own server, Godot 4 requires the following headers to be present, add these in your `.htaccess` or however your server lets you:

```
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

## Simple Demo

<Preview src="/demos/godot3/index.html" />

See the full [source code](https://github.com/asadm/playroom-docs/tree/main/examples/godot3-hello-world) for this demo. Here is [source code](https://github.com/asadm/playroom-docs/tree/main/examples/godot-hello-world) for the Godot 4 version.


## Next Steps

- You should be able to use most of [Playroom API](/docs/api.md) to build your game.
- You can use [On-screen Joystick](/components/joystick) to easily add a joystick on screen.

## FAQs and Tips

### How to display player's profile picture in Godot?
PlayroomPlayer.GetProfile().photo is formatted as `data:image/svg+xml,{svg encoded for url}`. **Churrosaur** from our Discord community shared this code snippet to display the player's profile picture in Godot:

```gdscript
func _parse_dataurl(data_url : String) -> Image:
	var url_data = data_url.split(",")[1] # clips the preface 
	var svg_data = url_data.uri_decode() # String.uri_decode() - parses uri
	
	var image = Image.new()
	var error = image.load_svg_from_string(svg_data) # loads svg from string
	if error != OK:
			push_error("Couldn't load the image.")
			
	return image
```

### How to display QR code for joining the game inside Godot?

You can use `JavaScriptBridge.eval(window.location.href)` to get current url (which includes room code) and then use any QRCode library like [this](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2090) to display QR code in Godot.
