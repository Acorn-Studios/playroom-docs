# Using Spline with Playroom Kit

  This section is under development and very experimental.

[Spline](https://spline.design/) is a free, real-time collaborative 3D design tool to create interactive experiences within the browser.

We, at Playroom love making game prototypes with Spline. Instead of remaking them in a game engine, wouldn't it be cool if we could just export the Spline project and add game logic and multiplayer on top of it?

Spline publishes [@splinetool/runtime](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@splinetool/runtime) NPM package. This package can be used to load Spline projects in your own website and has minimal API to control the scene.

This demo uses some internal APIs of Spline. Which is why it's not very stable for now.
