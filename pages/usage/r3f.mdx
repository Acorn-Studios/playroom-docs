# Using React Three Fiber with Playroom

React with Three.js is a powerful combination for creating 3D experiences on the web.

Playroom provides hooks for interacting with common Playroom states and player data. 

Here is a demo R3F app that uses Playroom Kit:

import Preview from '../../components/preview'

<Preview src="https://shooter.joinplayroom.com/" maxPlayers={0} />

You can see the full source code [here](https://github.com/asadm/playroom-docs/tree/main/examples/r3f-shooter-game).
