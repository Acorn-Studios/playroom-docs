## `insertCoin({ InitOptions })`

Tell Playroom to start! Playroom Kit will then handle room creation, players joining and also let players pick their names, colors and avatars. Once host taps "Launch", the promise resolves. At this point you can start your game.

```js
// Show Playroom UI, let it handle players joining etc and wait for host to tap "Launch"
await insertCoin();

// Start your game!
```

`InitOptions` is an object with the following properties:

| option       | type    | default | explanation                                                                 |
|--------------|---------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `streamMode` | boolean | false   | If  `true` , Playroom will start in [ stream mode ]( /multiplayer/stream ). |
| `allowGamepads` | boolean | false   | If  `true` , Playroom will let players play game using gamepads connected to the stream device itself. This requires `streamMode` to also be `true`.<br/><br/>The gamepads need to be connected to device where stream screen is running. No phones are required in this mode but are optionally allowed as an alternative controller if there aren't enough physical gamepads in the room. Players who join via phone in this mode see an on-screen [Joystick](/multiplayer/joystick). |
| `baseUrl`    | string  | *Current Page URL*      | The base URL used for generating room link that host shares with other players. |
| `avatars`    | Array&lt;string&gt; | *Default Avatars* | An array of URLs to images that players can pick as their avatar. This will override the default avatars system that Playroom provides. |
| `enableBots` | boolean | false | If 'true' , Playroom initializes a bot using the provided botOptions. |
| `botOptions` | [`BotOptions`](#botoptions) | undefined | An object containing parameters for bot instantiation and configuration. |
| `roomCode` | string | undefined | Override the room to join. If this is not set, a random room code is assigned. Do note that if the URL has room `#r=` param, that is used instead of this.|
| `skipLobby` | boolean | false | Skips the Playroom's lobby screen altogether. This is useful if you want to design your own multiplayer lobby. |
| `reconnectGracePeriod` | number | 0 | If set, Playroom will wait for the given **number of milliseconds** for the player to reconnect to the room after a disconnect. <br/><br/>If the player reconnects within the grace period, the player's state is restored. If the player does not reconnect within the grace period, the player is removed from the room and `onQuit` fires for the player. |

## `getState(key: string): any`

Returns the current value of the given key in the game state.

```js
const winnerId = getState('winner');
```

## `setState(key: string, value: any, reliable: boolean = true): void`

Sets the value of the given key in the game state. If `reliable` is `true`, the state is synced reliably to all players via Websockets. This is useful for game state that is critical to the game, like the winner. 

If `reliable` is `false`, the state is synced via WebRTC, which is faster but less reliable. This is useful for game state that is not critical to the game, like the player's current position (you can always rely on next position update).

```js
setState('winner', 'player1');
```

## `onPlayerJoin(callback)`

Register a callback that will be called when a new player joins the room. The callback will be called with the player's [`PlayerState`](#playerstate) object.

When you register this callback, it will first run with all existing players and then listen for new players joining the game. This is useful for "catching up" a player or getting the full list in a new game scene

```js
onPlayerJoin((player) => {
  console.log(`${player.id} joined!`);
});
```

## isHost()

Returns `true` if the current player is the host.

```js
if (isHost()) {
  // Do something only the host should do, like reading player input and setting game state
}
```

## `isStreamScreen()`

Returns `true` if the current screen is the stream screen; a non-player screen that is shown when the game is in [ stream mode ]( /multiplayer/stream ).

```js
if (isStreamScreen()) {
  // Do something only the stream screen should do, like showing a countdown
}
```

## `getRoomCode()`

Returns a 4-letter room code of the current room.

## `addBot()`

Adds a bot to the room. This is equivalent to pressing the "Add Bot" button in the lobby. Returns a promise that resolves to an instance of the class you provided in `botOptions.botClass` parameter in `insertCoin`.

```js
const newBot = await addBot();
```

## `myPlayer()` or `me()`

Returns the current player's [`PlayerState`](#playerstate) object.

```js
const player = myPlayer();
console.log(`Hello ${player.getProfile().name}!`);
```

## waitForState(stateKey: string): Promise&lt;any&gt;

Returns a promise that resolves to the state value only when the game state has the given key set, to any truthy value.

In other words, it waits until a game state is set. This is useful for waiting for the host to set the winner, for example.

```js
// Wait for the winner to be set
const winnerId = await waitForState('winner');
// Do something with the winner
```

## waitForPlayerState(player: [`PlayerState`](#playerstate), stateKey: string): Promise&lt;any&gt;

Returns a promise that resolves to the state value only when the player state has the given key set, to any truthy value.

In other words, it waits until a player state is set. This is useful for waiting for a player to play their turn, for example.

```js
// Wait for the the player to play their turn
const chosenThing = await waitForState('playedTurn');
// Do something with the thing
```


## PlayerState

A `PlayerState` object represents a player in the room. It has the following methods and properties:

### `id: string`

```js
console.log(`Player ID: ${player.id}`);
```

### `getProfile(): PlayerProfile`

| `color`  | Color  | The player's color.                                                         |
| `photo`  | string | The player's avatar. This is a `dataURL` to an image.                       |
| `avatarIndex` | number | The index of the player's picked avatar. This is an index into the `avatars` array passed to `insertCoin`. If no `avatars` array was passed, this is `-1`. |


The `Color` type is an object with the following properties:

| property | type   | explanation                                                                 |

| `hex`    | number | The color as a hex number, e.g. `0xff0000` for red.                         |


### `getState(key: string): any`

Returns the value of the given key in the player's state.

```js
const score = player.getState('score');
```

### `setState(key: string, value: any, reliable: boolean = false)`

Sets the value of the given key in the player's state.

If `reliable` is `true`, the state is synced reliably to all players via Websockets. This is useful for game state that is critical to the game, like the winner. 
If `reliable` is `false`, the state is synced via WebRTC, which is faster but less reliable. This is useful for game state that is not critical to the game, like the player's current position (you can always rely on next position update).

```js
player.setState('score', 10);
```

### `onQuit(callback): unsubscribeCallback`

Register a callback that will be called when the player quits the room.
Returns a function that can be called to unsubscribe the callback.

  console.log(`${player.id} quit!`);
});

// ...
unsubscribe();
```

### `isBot(): boolean`

Returns `true` if the player is a bot.

## Joystick Controller

### `Joystick(state: PlayerState, options: JoystickOptions)`

new Joystick(myPlayer(), {
  type: "dpad"
})
```

`JoystickOptions` is an object with the following properties:

| `icon`       | string  | `null`  | The button can have an icon. This is a URL to an image.


`ZoneOptions` let's you define zones on Joystick that are triggered when player drags Joystick in that zone. 
This behaves same as buttons above, `isPressed` method can be used to detect if a zone button is active or not. 
`ZoneOptions` is an object with the following properties:

| option       | type    | default | explanation

```js
if (joystick.isPressed('jump')) {
  // Jump!
}
```

### `isJoystickPressed(): boolean`

```js
const angle = joystick.angle();
```

### `dpad(): { x: string, y: string }`

Returns the direction of the joystick, as a string. The string can be one of the following:

- `up`
- `down`
- `left`
- `right`

### `destroy(): void`

## BotOptions

The `BotOptions` object is used to specify configurations for bots in the game. It consists of the following properties:

| Property      | Type                              | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `botClass`    | a class that extends [`Bot`](#bot)     | The class or constructor function used to instantiate a new bot. Should conform to the `Bot` interface.                                                      |
| `botParams`   | `Object` (optional)               | An object of parameters passed to the `botClass` constructor when creating a new bot instance. Useful for customizing and configuring individual bot behaviors. |

## Bot

The `Bot` interface represents an automated player. The `Bot` and its derived classes will have methods and properties similar to a [`PlayerState`](#playerstate) object.

**Note:** The behavior of a bot, particularly its decision-making and interactions, will heavily depend on its implementation and the given `botClass`. Ensure the bot's behaviors align with the game's requirements and player expectations.
