# Using Three.js with Playroom Kit

[three.js](https://threejs.org/) is a general purpose 3D library for Javascript.

Playroom works great with three.js to make multiplayer 3D games. Below is a **live preview** of a simple flying plane game adapted from [this code by Codrops](https://github.com/yakudoo/TheAviator).

Touch the screen to fly the plane.

import Preview from '../components/preview'
