# Setting up Playroom Kit

## Using NPM

If you are using npm, install Playroom Kit and its peer dependencies:

```bash copy
npm install --save playroomkit react react-dom
```

Then import it into your project:

```js copy
import { onPlayerJoin, insertCoin, isHost, myPlayer } from "playroomkit";
```

## Using a CDN

You can also directly include it via a script tag from a CDN like `unpkg.com` or our own `cdn.joinplayroom.com`, make sure to also include the peer dependencies also (react, react-dom):

```html copy
<body>
  <script src="https://cdn.joinplayroom.com/react@18.2.0/umd/react.development.js"></script>
  <script src="https://cdn.joinplayroom.com/react-dom@18.2.0/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
  <script src="https://cdn.joinplayroom.com/playroomkit/multiplayer.umd.js"></script>
  <script>
    const { onPlayerJoin, insertCoin, isHost, myPlayer } = Playroom;
  </script>
</body>
```

This will make the `Playroom` object available on the global scope.
