# Setting up Playroom Kit

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  **Note:** These methods may not apply to all engines (such as [Godot](https://docs.joinplayroom.com/usage/godot) or [Unity](https://docs.joinplayroom.com/usage/unity)). Please refer to the respective page for engine setup for explicit use.

## Using NPM
If you are using npm, install Playroom Kit and its peer dependencies:
```bash copy
npm install --save playroomkit react react-dom
```
Then import it into your project:
```js copy
import { onPlayerJoin, insertCoin, isHost, myPlayer } from "playroomkit";
```
## Using a CDN

You can also directly include it via a script tag from a CDN like `unpkg.com` or our own `cdn.joinplayroom.com`, make sure to also include the peer dependencies also (react, react-dom):

```html
<body>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/playroomkit/multiplayer.full.umd.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
  <script>
    #Do what you want
    Playroom.doSomething()
  </script>
</body>
```

This example imports the `Playroom` scope which can be used by your game.
