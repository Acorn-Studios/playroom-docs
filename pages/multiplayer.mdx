# Making a Multiplayer Game

Whether you're developing a new game or transitioning an existing one to a multiplayer format, Playroom simplifies the process with low-code integration. Here's a general outline of the steps involved

## Steps
import { Steps } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

<Steps>

### Handle players joining and quiting
When a player joins, you probably need to add a player sprite to the game. When a player quits, you need to remove the player sprite from the game.

### Pass player input to Playroom
Input can be anything like joystick data, button presses etc. Host will receive input events and update the game state. No network code needed!

### Pass your game state to Playroom
Things like player position, health, score etc. Ideally only the **host** should send the game state. Other players will only receive the game state from the host and update their game accordingly.

### Insert Coin!
Tell Playroom to start! Playroom Kit will automatically handle room creation, joining and also let players pick their names, colors and avatars. Once host taps "Launch", the game will start.

## Demo #1

Here is a very basic platformer made with Phaser and made multiplayer using Playroom Kit. You can either try it below or scan the QR code to play it on your phone.

### Code for the above demo
Here is the **complete code** for the above demo. The multiplayer code is highlighted: 


```js {11,14-20,32-35,42,56-59,64-68,89-91} filename="Without Multiplayer"
import nipplejs from "nipplejs";
import Phaser from "phaser";
import { onPlayerJoin, insertCoin, isHost, myPlayer } from "playroomkit";

class Main extends Phaser.Scene {
  controls = {};
  players = []; 

  create() {
    // 1. Handle players joining and quiting.
    onPlayerJoin(player => this.addPlayer(player));

    // 2. Pass player input to Playroom.
    const joystick = nipplejs.create();
    joystick.on("plain", (e, data) => {
      myPlayer().setState("dir", data.direction);
    });
    joystick.on("end", () => {
      myPlayer().setState("dir", undefined);
    });
  }

  addPlayer(playerState) {
    const sprite = this.add.rectangle(
      Phaser.Math.Between(100, 500), 200, 50, 50, playerState.getProfile().color.hex);
    this.physics.add.existing(sprite, false);
    sprite.body.setCollideWorldBounds(true);
    this.players.push({
      sprite,
      state: playerState
    });
    playerState.onQuit(() => {
      sprite.destroy();
      this.players = this.players.filter(p => p.state !== playerState);
    });
  }

  update() {
    // 3. Pass your game state to Playroom.
    if (isHost()){
      for (const player of this.players) {
        const controls = player.state.getState("dir") || {};
        if (controls.x == "left") {
          player.sprite.body.setVelocityX(-160);
        }
        else if (controls.x == "right") {
          player.sprite.body.setVelocityX(160);
        }
        else{
          player.sprite.body.setVelocityX(0);
        }
    
        if (controls.y == "up" && player.sprite.body.onFloor()) {
          player.sprite.body.setVelocityY(-330);
        }
        player.state.setState("pos", {
          x: player.sprite.x,
          y: player.sprite.y,
        });
      }
    }
    else{
      for (const player of this.players) {
        const pos = player.state.getState("pos");
        if (pos){
          player.sprite.x = pos.x;
          player.sprite.y = pos.y;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

const config = {
  type: Phaser.AUTO,
  width: 300,
  height: 480,
  parent: 'root',
  physics: {
    default: 'arcade',
    arcade: {
      gravity: { y: 700 }
    }
  },
  scene: Main
};

// 4. Insert Coin! Start the game.
insertCoin().then(() => {
  const game = new Phaser.Game(config);
});

```
