# Types of Games Supported by Playroom

Playroom supports a variety of game configurations. Players can be in the same room, long-distance, or a combination of both. The following are some types of game settings supported by Playroom:

## Mobile-to-Mobile
<div className={styles.halfhalf}>
<div>
  This is the most common type. Players are playing multiplayer on their mobile devices either in same room or long-distance. Players create a room and share the game link with other players. Players can also join the room by scanning a QR code with their camera.

</div>

## Stream Mode with Players on Phone

<div className={styles.halfhalf}>
<div>
  This is a variation of the mobile-to-mobile setting. Players are playing multiplayer on their mobile devices. However, an instance of the game is streamed to a TV, PC, etc. which acts as a central screen players can look at. 

  This lets you then make phones the controllers for the game. The central screen may also be optional leaderboard or a spectator screen giving an overview of the game for non-players. This type of game is great for parties and events.

</div>

## Stream Mode with Bluetooth/USB Gamepads
<div className={styles.halfhalf}>
<div>
Playroom also lets you make games that are played on a TV or a central screen with physical game controllers that are connected to that TV or PC via Bluetooth/USB.

Ran out of controllers, more players can also join the action with their mobile devices. Players on phones see on-screen [Joystick controls](/multiplayer/joystick) to play the game. The API remains common for both types of controllers, so as a developer you don't have to worry about the type of controller being used.

## Stream Mode with Discord/Twitch
<div className={styles.halfhalf}>
<div>
Playroom also lets you make games that are played on a TV or a central screen with players joining in via Discord or Twitch. This is still in development and we will add more details soon.
