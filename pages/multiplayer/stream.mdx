Stream mode multiplayer is the ideal choice for IO games hosted on the web, where players join the game using a secondary device as a controller. In this scenario, it is essential to ensure that the game you are developing always designates a host who shares their screen, while other players actively participate and spectate the gameplay. This approach enhances the overall gaming experience by facilitating seamless interaction between the host and the players, creating an immersive and engaging environment for all participants
