If your game involves players using their phones as controllers while looking at a shared screen (e.g. Jackbox games), you can use Stream Mode to create such multiplayer experience. 

Stream Mode is ideal for party games, team-building games, Twitch streamer style games, and more.

## Getting started

The main difference here is that you need to differentiate between the **Stream** screen and the **Controller** screen and show the appropriate screen.

When you pass `streamMode: true` to Playroom's `insertCoin`. Playroom automatically detects if it's running on a larger screen or a phone screen. If it's running on a larger screen, it will show the instructions to join the room. If it's running on a phone screen, it will let player pick their name and color.

### Do the multiplayer steps
As described [here](/multiplayer#steps).

### Show separate screens for Stream and Controller
You can use the `isStreamScreen()` helper function to detect what screen you're on and show the appropriate screen.

```js
import { isStreamScreen } from 'playroomkit';
...
if (isStreamScreen()) {
  // Show the Stream screen
} else {
  // Show the Controller screen
}
```

### Insert Coin!
When you call `insertCoin`, pass `streamMode: true` to it.

```js
import { insertCoin } from 'playroomkit';
...
await insertCoin({ streamMode: true });
startGame();
```

</Steps>
