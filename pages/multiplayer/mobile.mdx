Playroom is a web-based multiplayer framework that works well for both Mobile and Web games. We ensure consistent latency management across all devices. This means that every player will have a synchronized gaming experience, observing the game exactly as it is intended to be seen.

## Steps to make a multiplayer game

Mobile-Web multiplayer mode is the default mode for Playroom. This means that you don't need to do anything special to enable it.
Just follow the steps described [here](/multiplayer#steps) to make a multiplayer game.

After this, just publish your game on the internet just like any other website and share the link. Players can then host and join the game from their mobile devices.
