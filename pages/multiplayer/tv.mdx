Games that are deployed directly on Playroom (upcoming) can leverage TV mode integration to provide a seamless gaming experience on the big screen.

# What is TV mode?

TV mode let's you initiate stream mode directly from your phone and leverage Airplay or Chromecast functionality to display the stream screen on TV while displaying the controller screen on your phone.

# How does it work

Games with TV mode enabled will automatically launch in the Playroom AppClip (upcoming) when the user scans the QR code or taps the link. The AppClip will then have an option to cast the game to the TV. Once the game is casted, the user can start playing the game on the TV while the controller screen is displayed on the phone.
