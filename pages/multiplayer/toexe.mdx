  This feature relies on third-party software and may not be suited to paid games or non-host players*

  This is best used for hosts of games using [steam mode](https://docs.joinplayroom.com/multiplayer/stream)* (see above)

## Using Nativefier
<Callout emoji=":bulb:">
  Note: Nativefier is unmaintained, please see [#1577](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier/issues/1577).
</Callout>

### Installation

1. Install `Node.js` > https://nodejs.org/en/download

2. Install Nativefier globally with `npm install -g nativefier`

3. Make sure you have `C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\npm` set as a system env. variable. (See [Stack overflow: global npm package installed but command not found](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29955217/global-npm-package-installed-but-command-not-found))

That's it! 

You may need to fix some vulnerabilities with npm. You can do this by using the `npm audit fix` command.

### Usage

1. Deploy your project to any domain name; for this example, we will use `game-test.playroom.gg`, but anything works. We recommend using playroom's built-in deployments or using [github sites](github.io)

2. Run the `nativefier game-test.playroom.gg --platform windows` command, replacing `game-test.playroom.gg` with whatever your domain is (can also be a subdirectory such as `game-test.playroom.gg/game.html`). Also, make sure to replace `--platform windows` with whatever platform you are building for like `windows`, `linux`, `mac`, `osx`, etc (see [this](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier/blob/HEAD/API.md#platform) for more platforms)

3. That's it!

### Limitations

- Can only be used for hosting games because there is no way to use a room code*

- May be prone to vulnerablilites (see [#1577](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier/issues/1577))

- Should **not** be used for paid games on platforms like steam (where you need to pay to get the game) as the website will be exposed (meaning people can play without paying)

### Problems With `nativefier` Command

- Make sure you have `C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\npm` set as a system env. variable. (See [Stack overflow: global npm package installed but command not found](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29955217/global-npm-package-installed-but-command-not-found))

- See the [Nativefier Catalog](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier/blob/master/CATALOG.md)

- Try downloading and setting up the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download). Then reinstall Nativefier

### Notes

*This is because there is no native way to input a code in playroom. With this method, you can only go to a fixed url (not something like `game-test.playroom.gg/room=RXGDP`, just whatever you compiled the app with). This can be solved by having a custom code input method that redirects to the correct url (`game-test.playroom.gg/room=RXGDP`)
