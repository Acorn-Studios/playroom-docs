# December Update: Death by AI, Twitch Insights and Godot

<AuthorBio author="tabish" date="Dec 06 2023" />

November was filled with numerous game launches across different distribution platforms, and we're still actively releasing new games with studios and new multiplayer modes in our SDK.

I'll keep this update brief and will concentrate on numbers and insights. In the next one, we'll share our vision for 2024 and how Playroom aims to become synonymous with casual multiplayer gaming.

A quick highlight, I really appreciate receiving inbound messages from industry veterans like Timmu Toke (CEO of Ready Player Me), who appreciated our technology and vision. These messages keep fueling us to move forward in our mission.

In the first week of November, we soft launched a new game called "Death by AI" ([play here](https://deathbyai.gg/)) a Jackbox-style party game. The game was developed in eight weeks, a feat made possible by the rapid development and backend abstraction provided by Playroom Kit.

**In 20 days:**

*   Thanks to our community and YouTube superpowers, the game was picked for playtesting by over **30 Twitch streamers**.
    
*   "Death by AI" **ranked #1 on Hackernews** for more than 6 hours.
    
*   During the open beta, we saw over **70,000 users**, with a **Week 1 retention rate of 40%**.
    
*   For social casual gaming, Twitch and YouTube were the primary sources of traffic.
    
*   In total, we recorded over **100,000 game sessions** with almost **10,000 hours** of gameplay in 20 days.
    

**Game streamers (Twitch) market:**

We believe the market has not yet fully recognized the demand for live streaming and social games, presenting a massive missed opportunity. Given the speed and eagerness with which these Twitch streamers tried new games to play with their communities, it's evident that game streamers are constantly seeking new content to engage their audience, rather than sticking with the same incumbents.
