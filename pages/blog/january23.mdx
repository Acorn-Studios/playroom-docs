# AssemblyAI Hack Winner & SDK

<AuthorBio author="tabish" date="Jan 01 2023" />

Happy New Year! ðŸ¥³

As we embark on another exciting year, I want to share our vision and bring you along on our journey.

At Playroom, _our ultimate goal is to create the most accessible game platform for people to come together, play, and remix casual games._ We are constantly evolving with the industry and striving to achieve this vision. Here are some highlights.

## Winner of AssemblyAI
Our first prototype in generative AI, [superpaint.io](https://superpaint.io/) won AssemblyAI award ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/AssemblyAI/status/1602717569659682816?s=20&t=QBJK27wwvMCRw_eYWpswOQ)). We plan to take this further and make this part of our UGC game tooling to supercharge game creativity

The available web tech stack was inefficient for building rapid games and slowed us down. So we developed our own Visual SDK, which makes development 10x faster. [Think of it like Stripe checkout for game development](https://checkout.stripe.dev/configure) ([check website for details](https://joinplayroom.com/sdk))

All games built using this SDK on Playroom are multi-player, multi-surface(Web,TV, mobile) Big Win for us!

## Exploring AI generated games

The recent advancements in generative AI have us very excited, as it aligns perfectly with our mission of building games accessible to everyone(ðŸ“¹ [our vision](https://youtu.be/2f4wt8475PM)).

We believe that AI has the potential to play a major role in the gaming industry, with its limitless possibilities for generating assets and new game content in just minutes. SDK+AI could lead to a fresh, new experience every time you play. We will push in this area once we close our pre-seed.

*   **Pre-seed:** We are open to pre-seed investors interested in the space of UGC, AI Tools and Short-form games. Please reach out [tabish@joinplayroom.com](mailto:tabish@joinplayroom.com), and we would love to share our progress and demo.
    
*   **Party Games:** Casual multiplayer games that are inclusive and easy to play. They can be enjoyed by people of all ages and require no learning. These games are short-form and are a great way to have fun with friends and family.
