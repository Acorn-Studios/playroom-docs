# October & November Update: Community-driven Success

<AuthorBio author="tabish" date="Nov 02 2023" />

Writing this on the day I celebrate another year of life, and I'm just about to head out with kids. But before I go, I want to express how incredibly exciting it is to think about the future we aim to unlock with Playroom. The world is craving more games that can be enjoyed with friends, family, colleagues, and communities, yet there isn't enough enjoyable content for everyone to play together. Our goal is to 100x social multiplayer games, aiming to increase their availability by a hundredfold and all our efforts are laser-focused on realizing this vision

Talking about our monthly updates, I've got exciting updates to spill. So let's dive right in.

_Intro: Playroom helps new and seasoned developers to build Social Multiplayer Games in minutes_

### **Powering Multi on Bunch**

Bunch, one of our closest design partners, has been a pivotal collaboration for us. We've been right by their side, fueling the launch of their instant multiplayer games.

Currently, we have around five to six more games in the pipeline with them, and our goal is to reach 300k Monthly Active Users (MAU) across all games on Bunch crafted using Playroom within the next 2-3 months. This partnership has taught us about the complexities of cross-platform integrations and the essential features needed to build social games. Our aim? To streamline the process and SDK, so others won't have to reinvent the wheel when shipping games across different platforms

**Case study Insights:**

*   With social games, developers see 4x time spent by users on platforms.
    
*   Unparalleled adaptability; our games seamlessly deploy on any social platform, molding themselves to each user's identity, thereby crafting a truly personalized experience.

### **Supporting Axie Infinity**

Our consistent community posts have brought about another remarkable milestone – they caught the attention of prominent gaming entities, including Axie Infinity. In their words, they were genuinely "impressed by the developer experience" and expressed a keen interest in sharing our platform with their developers.

This emerging partnership led to a collaboration on the [Axie gamejam](https://hub.skymavis.com/axie-game-jam/2023), where we offered support to participants in creating multiplayer games using Playroom. [The Axie team developed a prototype and proudly presented it to their community](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x68Z9aocwxE). It's incredibly thrilling when our partners become enthusiastic advocates of our platform!

### **Creator led Acquisition**

We teamed up with YouTube creators such as [WawaSensei](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=ns0z7aWFLyjK7eSg&t=933&v=nQI8UNe6cfA&feature=youtu.be), who educates their audience about game development. This collaboration proved to be a highly effective strategy for attracting independent developers. With just one video, we're witnessing a daily influx of 10-20 developers onboarding, testing, and [remixing game templates using our SDK](https://shooter.joinplayroom.com/#r=RIR39).

Given this success, we're strategizing to engage 2-3 creators as long-term content partners. This approach will enable us to maintain a continuous flow of tutorials and enhance our user acquisition process.
