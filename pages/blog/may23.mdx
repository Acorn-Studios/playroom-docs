# SDK & AI Game Editor

<AuthorBio author="tabish" date="May 01 2023" />

Wow, April was a rollercoaster ride! With Ramadan taking up so much of our time and energy, it felt like we were on a never-ending marathon. But despite the challenges, falling a little behind on our goals set for this month, we still managed to make some good progress.

We may have had to make some adjustments along the way, but that just goes to show how adaptable we are as a team. Plus, who doesn't love a good challenge? It keeps things interesting and helps us grow.

In this note I will not only reflect on what we've achieved so far, but also share what else needs to be validated in the months to come.

## üõ†Ô∏è SDK progress

We are iterating with SDK internally and planning how our first public API would look like. We did face a few hurdles and questions with balancing between complex but capable vs. simple but limited APIs. Also, we did not want our SDK's first version to be "trying to do everything" and an end-to-end replacement for the existing workflow of a developer.

Keeping all this in mind, we are designing SDK's v1 as a drop-in solution to add multiplayer in your existing or new games. Playroom Multiplayer provides everything from room management, matchmaking, player management, and state synchronization, all abstracted away in a simple API.

> **One important benefit of this approach is we can onboard existing web games onto the Playroom platform by dropping-in our multiplayer layer.**

Playroom SDK is going to be the easiest way to make your game multiplayer. More on this very soon!

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Game Editor

Finally! The foundations have been laid for our Editor. Why we doing editor you may ask? SDK is for game developers while AI editor opens up new audience and empower GenZs and Alphas‚Äôs with new tools to build fun experiences.

While our initial goal was to put it in the hands of beta users by the end of April, we may have been a tad ambitious in our timeline. Building something from scratch with just one engineering person is no small feat, after all!

But fear not, we are making significant progress and are confident that we will soon be able to deliver a high-quality product to our beta users.

**Milestones achieved:**

*   Editor is functional with limited features
    
*   You can use it to edit a demo trivia game with your own content.
    
*   Adding multiple rounds is easy using our intuitive UX.¬†
    
*   Or generate a full game using our AI and edit as needed.
    
*   Publishing feature lets you can preview your game instantly.
