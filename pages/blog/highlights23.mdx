# Playroom Highlights: Let's review last 6 months

<AuthorBio author="tabish" date="Dec 22 2023" />

Around May, we decided to go all-in on building a multiplayer platform for the next generation of games. Initially an internal project for our own games, we soon realized its greater potential if opened to everyone.

Shortly thereafter, we witnessed a significant shift in the market, AAA downsizing. This led to the emergence of more small to mid-sized studios, poised to develop the next wave of hit games. And an opportunity for more collaboration.

Multiplayer, social, and live is the future but it is painful to build. For these teams to compete, there's only one strategy: Ship quickly and Maintain quality.

To help small studios compete with the giants in the casual gaming space, a new approach to development is essential. We foresee a change in the way games are made, with innovative tech stacks, AI integrations and new engines.

Playroom is not just a solution to solve the multiplayer issues of past; it's an infrastructure designed for the future. We aim to move beyond simply addressing the current challenges faced by Unity, Godot, or long-established studios. Those entities are firmly rooted in their traditional methods.

Instead, we will collaborate with change makers and new game studios who have firsthand experience of past difficulties and understand what is necessary for the future of live and multiplayer.

Our goal is to increase the number of multiplayer games by a hundredfold. This won't just be achieved by solving backend issues; it will also involve offering better workflows, necessary integrations, and APIs in conjunction with our multiplayer platform - the foundation for everything else, akin to Firebase but for games.

In just 6 months, here is what we accomplished:

- 🐥 Expanded from a team of 2 to 5
- 📱 Introduced 3 multiplayer modes: Phone, Web, Stream.
- 🕹️ Supported the launch of over 5 games.
- 🙌🏽 Worked with over 7 studios.
- 🌟 Unveiled more than 8 open-source game templates.
- 🚂 Integrated with 10 game engines.
- 💬 Released over 50 SDK changelogs.
- 🕵️‍♀️ Supported more than 3,000 developers at events.
- 🍻 Surpassed 12,000 npm downloads.
- 🚀 Managed around 150,000 monthly players across various games.

Looking back, I realize that we have accomplished so much in such a short amount of time. There is still so much to come, with many exciting launches ahead, and I look forward to collaborating with all the changemakers! 🍻
