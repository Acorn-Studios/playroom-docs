# Multiplayer & AI Trivia

<AuthorBio author="tabish" date="Jan 01 2023" />

In our last update, we shared our excitement with generative AI and how we believe that _**GPT** (Content) + **STABLE**(Asset) + **Playroom Template** (Logic)_ can make it accessible for anyone to build games in minutes. \[**üìπ [Check demo here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f4wt8475PM)\]**

Today, we are sharing our January updates, where we focussed on one game type and made great progress as a two-person team. Despite the challenges of balancing between building and fundraising efforts, we engaged in productive discussions with several funds and made meaningful strides toward our GTM.

## GPT Experiment

Our experiment of converting GPT to Trivia showed a daily generation of 30-40 of trivia games. To our surprise, the topics ranged from common celebrity quizzes to educational tests, showcasing a broad range of use cases.

## Multiplayer Module

Multiplayer is one of the biggest pain points among game makers. Costing on average $200k on development. We completed a Multiplayer module in our SDK which transforms _ANY_ game into a multiplayer experience. _This enables us to offer Playroom's decentralized service to game publishers, a critical step forward in our journey_.

## Early access: Booom

Based on the feedback from the community and friends, we've transformed AI Trivia into a thrilling multiplayer game, ‚ÄúBooom.ai‚ÄùüïπÔ∏è [You can play here](https://joinplayroom.com/games). We're currently fine-tuning the game and plan to showcase it on Producthunt later this week. Play with friends, host a session at work, or challenge your family to exciting trivia battles on any topic.

*   **What's next**: Based on the Trivia launch response, we will potentially take two paths. 1) Build 2 more games using AI Template to demonstrate versatility. 2) Launch V1 of SDK to indie devs/students for game remixing.
    
*   **Party Games:** Casual multiplayer games that are inclusive and easy to play. They can be enjoyed by people of all ages and require no learning. These games are short-form and are a great way to have fun with friends and family.
