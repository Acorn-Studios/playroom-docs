Cloudflare today announced 29 companies from thousands who were selected to join their Workers Launchpad Cohort 3! I am excited to share, Playroom is one of them.

It's been an exciting journey to utilize Cloudflare to offer new ways to build multiplayer games.

Our goal - make it easier than ever for small teams to create big games.

Small Teams, Big Games!

Games that used to take months can now be completed in weeks, with playtesting available in a matter of minutes through our dev portal. We are thrilled to expand beyond multiplayer and provide modules that would make building AI games, Discord games, Web games, Social Hubs and more, accessible with Playroom.
