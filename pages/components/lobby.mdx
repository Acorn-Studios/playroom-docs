# Lobby UI in Playroom

Integrating Playroom provides you with synchronized in-game multiplayer lobby. This UI is enabled by default, streamlining the process of testing your multiplayer game right away. It takes care of all aspects of player and room management, allowing you to dive into your testing immediately.

You have the flexibility to retain, customize, or completely remove this UI from your game. The lobby currently consists of following components with more features to be added in future releases.

import { Card, Cards } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

<Cards>
  <Card
    style={{}}
    title={<div><h4>Room</h4><div style={{fontSize:"0.8em"}}>In order to allow players to host and join games, Lobby creates a room with unique code that users can share with other players. </div></div>}
    href=""
  />
   <Card
    style={{}}
    title={<div><h4>Sharing</h4><div style={{fontSize:"0.8em"}}>Lobby also includes a QR code UI that can be scanned by other players to join the game easily.</div></div>}
    href=""
  />

  <Card
    style={{}}
    title={<div><h4>Avatar System</h4><div style={{fontSize:"0.8em"}}>A procedurally-generated avatar system is hooked in the lobby that generates unique avatar for the players.</div></div>}
    href=""
  />
  <Card
    style={{}}
    title={<div><h4>Player</h4><div style={{fontSize:"0.8em"}}>Players can set their nickname and color. The color can be used to identify players in the game.</div></div>}
    href=""
  />

</Cards>

## Example

import Preview from '../../components/preview'

<Preview src="/demos/react1.html" maxPlayers={0} />


## Advanced Usage

### Setting room code, name and photo from URL params
Playroom defaults to picking a random room code, player name, color, avatar for each player. If you want to set these values from URL params, you can do so by passing `r`, `player_name` and `player_photo` params to the URL. The photo is a URL to an image.

For example, if you want to join room `ABCD` and also set the name to "John" and the photo to "https://example.com/john.png", you can do so by opening the following URL:

```
https://mygame.com/#r=ABCD&player_name=John&player_photo=https://example.com/john.png
```

You can also combine this with the `skipLobby` option to skip the lobby UI and take the player directly to the room with the name and photo already set from the URL params.

### Changing the Avatar System

Playroom's lobby includes a procedurally-generated avatar system. If you want to use your own avatars, you can do so by passing a custom `avatars` image list to the [`insertCoin` method](https://docs.joinplayroom.com/apidocs#insertcoin-initoptions-). This list should contain a list of image URLs.

```js
import { insertCoin } from 'playroomkit';

const avatars = [
  'https://example.com/avatar1.png',
  'https://example.com/avatar2.png',
  'https://example.com/avatar3.png',
];

await insertCoin({
  avatars,
});

// much later, when you want to get the avatar for a player
// see: https://docs.joinplayroom.com/apidocs#getprofile-playerprofile
const avatar = avatars[player.getProfile().avatarIndex];
```


### Skipping the Lobby UI

If your game needs to have a custom lobby UI, you can skip Playroom's lobby UI by passing `skipLobby: true` to the [`insertCoin` method](https://docs.joinplayroom.com/apidocs#insertcoin-initoptions-).

This will skip the lobby UI and take the player directly to the game.

Few things to consider when going this route:
#### 1. You will need to implement your own profile system
The existing `player.getProfile()` method will not work. You can set profile info just like any other state of your game. 

#### 2. Hosting and joining UI
You can compose your own URL scheme or a "room code"-type of method to allow players to host and join games. You can use the [`getRoomCode`](https://docs.joinplayroom.com/apidocs#getroomcode) method to get the unique room code for the current game.

On the other side, you can pass the `roomCode` param to the [`insertCoin` method](https://docs.joinplayroom.com/apidocs#insertcoin-initoptions-) to join the room.

Using these methods, either show room code in your own UI (like: "Your room code is: ABCD") or use it to compose a URL (like: `https://example.com/#codeparam=ABCD`) that players can use to join the same room. 

Do note that you need to handle reading the `roomCode` param from the URL and passing it to the `insertCoin` method yourself. Playroom does not handle this for you.
