# Persistent Storage in Playroom

Playroom [State](/components/state) is cleared when all players leave the room. For some types of games, you may want to persist some data in your room that can be retrieved later when the player comes back to the same room. 

Playroom provides a simple persistent storage API. The data is stored in the room until it is explicitly deleted or the expiry time is reached.

## Usage

### Create room with persistent storage enabled

```javascript
await insertCoin({persistentMode: true});
```

### Store data in the room

```javascript
await setPersistentData('somekey', {foo: 'bar'});
```

### Retrieve data from the room

```javascript
const data = await getPersistentData('somekey'); // {foo: 'bar'}
```

### Delete data from the room

```javascript
await setPersistentData('somekey', undefined);
```

### Insert Data into an Array
  
  ```javascript
  await insertPersistentData('somekey', 'value1');
  await insertPersistentData('somekey', 'value2');
  // getting the data
  const data = await getPersistentData('somekey'); // ['value1', 'value2']
  ```
